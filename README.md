# Fat Bear Week Randomiser

A small program to automate the randomising of the company Fat Bear Week sweepstake, in which each person gets randomly assigned a bear. The program will allocate unique bears to each person inputted until there are no more bears left, at which point it will then use a pseudo-random function to assign the remaining people an existing bear. Simply follow the prompts and you can join in Fat Bear Week too!
